# GeoApp

### Deployed with Zeit -Now [View DEMO](https://geoapp-mbc2dr3be.now.sh/)

- React app with a GraphQL Server (Apollo Server 2) on the backend, a cloud MongoDB database (Mongo Atlas) with React Context API to manage our state (instead of Redux!)
 
- Social Authentication (Google OAuth2), realtime data with GraphQL Subscriptions, image uploads with Cloudinary 

- App will be a live geolocation app  where users can 'pin' different locations on the map and share their own content with other users in realtime--to share pictures, reviews of the location and area, interact with other users by adding comments to their pins, and manage the pins they've created.
